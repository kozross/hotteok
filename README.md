Hotteok is meant to completely replace Haddock for documentation generation from
GHC 9 onwards. It aims to clear away the cruft, and be maintainable, modern and
efficient.

## Why the name?

A [hotteok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotteok) is a delicious sweet Korean
pancake. Its pronunciation is similar-sounding to 'haddock', and it is easy,
sweet and delicious: all things we are aiming towards. Plus, it's Haskell - how
could we possibly avoid wordplay?
