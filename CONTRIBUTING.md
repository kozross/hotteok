First of all, thank you!

## Requirements

Please format the Cabal file using
[`cabal-fmt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-fmt), and the source
code using [`ormolu`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu). Both of these
can be installed using `cabal new-install`.

Please ensure that your contributed code implements all suggestions offered by
[HLint](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint). You can also `cabal
new-install` this.
